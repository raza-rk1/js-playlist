# JavaScript and classes    
 - JavaScript dont have classes because js is a prototype based langauge and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar.

## OOPs

## Object 
- Collection of properties and methods (properties means variable or constants , methods means function)
-toLowerCase , promise are object 

## why use OOP 
 - Object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript enhances code organization, reusability, and abstraction. It promotes encapsulation for secure data handling, supports inheritance for code hierarchy, and facilitates polymorphism for adaptable interfaces. OOP improves code readability and maintainability, aligns with popular frameworks, and allows flexibility by combining procedural and object-oriented approaches.

## parts of OOP
 - Object Literal  : In JavaScript, an object literal is a way to create an object by listing its properties and values directly in the code using curly braces.
  const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  job: "Developer"
};


- Constructor function
- prototype 
- Instances ( new , this )

# 4 pillars 
Abstraction   - example fetch : hiding internal details 
Encapsulation  -  wrapping of data and function into single unit 
Inheritence    - 
polymorphism  - poly means many and morphism means form
